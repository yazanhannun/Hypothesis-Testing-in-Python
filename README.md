# Hypothesis-Testing-in-Python

Hypothesis testing lets you answer questions about your datasets in a statistically rigorous way. In this repository, 
We'll use Python analytical skills with tests like t-tests, proportion tests, and chi-square tests. In order to gain a 
deep understanding of these tests and their assumptions, I will work with real-world data, such as Stack Overflow user 
feedback and supply-chain data pertaining to medical supply shipments.
